# Adobe-GenSolve-Hackathon

We're two final-year BTech CSE students, class of 2025, actively seeking SDE internships and FTE opportunities. We're eager to join the Adobe team—it's our dream. We’ve attached our resumes to this repository, hoping you'll consider us for an interview. Take a look and see if we're worthy of the opportunity.
